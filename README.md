# Custom OpenAI Chatbot

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to create a chatbot using OpenAI's models and API, tailored to answer queries based on a set of course notes on dieting.

The core components of the project include:
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the notebook.
- `project.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that contains step-by-step instructions and code to build, train, and interact with the dieting chatbot.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7 or newer). You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
2. **pip**: If you haven't already, you'll need to install pip, the Python package manager. It's usually included with Python installations, but in case it's not, refer to [this guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
   
3. **Jupyter Notebook**: The project uses Jupyter Notebook. If you don't have it, install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yfe404/openai-custom-chatbot.git
   cd openai-custom-chatbot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open a new page in your web browser with a list of the files in the current directory. Click on `project.ipynb` to open the notebook.

### Usage

1. **Navigate Through the Notebook**: `project.ipynb` is structured in a step-by-step format. Simply follow the instructions and run each cell sequentially.

2. **API Key Setup**: Ensure you have your OpenAI API key at hand, as you'll need it to interact with the OpenAI models. If you don't have one, sign up on the OpenAI platform. The API Key should be placed in the relevant cell in the Jupyter notebook. 

3. **Train & Test**: The notebook will guide you through setting up your chatbot, training it on the dieting course notes, and then testing its capability to answer related queries.


Happy coding and happy dieting! ðŸ¥—ðŸ¤–
